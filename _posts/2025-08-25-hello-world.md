I've never been much of a blogger; but I am familiar with the notion that one of the best ways to learn something is by teaching it, so here my journey begins...

## A Little About Me  

I‚Äôm 32, and for a long time I thought I‚Äôd end up as a pilot or a police officer. Flying lessons were out of reach, and the polygraph wasn‚Äôt exactly my friend. Eventually, though, I convinced a federal law enforcement agency to hire me. Before I knew it, I was getting screamed at by men in big hats at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy (FLETC) in New Mexico.  

It wasn‚Äôt my first taste of stress‚Äîback in 2015 I completed 14 weeks of Army One Station Unit Training (OSUT) at Ft. Benning, GA after enlisting in the Army National Guard.  

By 2018, with a B.S. in Business Administration (MIS) in hand, I decided to finally lean into something that had always come more naturally to me: technology. I‚Äôd been the family IT guy and lifelong gamer, so I cracked open a stack of CompTIA study guides and set off on a new path.

## Breaking Into IT  

I can attribute a few things to landing my first IT role:  

- A solid job market  
- My degree  
- An A+ certification  
- And a manager willing to give me a shot  

From there, I grew quickly. I started in **IT Helpdesk**, then moved into roles across:  

- **Application Support**  
- **Citrix/Xen environments** (air-gapped networks)  
- **QA support** with Jenkins CI/CD for infra deployments  
- **Traditional SysAdmin tasks**, with a sprinkle of cloud (AWS EC2)  

Each step gave me a stronger foundation across networks, virtualization, and infrastructure‚Äîlearning by firehose and leaning on good mentors.

## The DoD Pivot  

My biggest shift came when I began working with **DoD systems**. On one hand, it was eye-opening: mission-critical infrastructure, built to be resilient and secure. But the cracks showed fast‚Äîoutdated tech stacks, siloed teams, and layers of bureaucracy that made even small changes painful. It was stable, but it wasn‚Äôt innovative.  

That‚Äôs when I realized I wanted something different.

## Why DevOps  

I‚Äôve felt the limits of traditional sysadmin work‚Äîendless RDP sessions, ticket queues, and manual tasks. What excites me now is **automation, collaboration, and modern tooling**. I enjoy living in the IDE: writing scripts, building pipelines, and treating infrastructure as code.  

This blog is my way of capturing the lessons I learn as I pivot into DevOps. There will be mistakes, restarts, and plenty of ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments‚Äîbut that‚Äôs the point.  

Ultimately, I want this to be a record of growth: not just technical skills, but mindset. DevOps is about culture as much as tools, and I‚Äôm excited to learn both sides of the coin.  

If you stumble across these posts, I hope you‚Äôll find them useful‚Äîor at least relatable‚Äîas I document my journey into a field that never stops evolving. üöÄ
